                    NEUROASSIST PROJECT WRITE-UP
      Dementia Early Detection & Cognitive Monitoring Platform
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

NeuroAssist is a comprehensive web-based cognitive health monitoring platform 
designed for early detection of dementia and continuous tracking of cognitive 
function. The system provides accessible tools for patients to log daily 
activities, complete cognitive assessments, and practice brain exercises, while 
enabling caregivers to monitor cognitive health trends and receive real-time 
alerts about concerning patterns.

This is a clinically-informed, browser-based solution that requires NO external 
devices, cameras, sensors, or machine learning models, making it immediately 
deployable and highly accessible.


PURPOSE & OBJECTIVES

    structured assessments, providing caregivers with actionable insights while 
    maintaining patient dignity and independence.

Key Objectives:
    1. ACCESSIBILITY: Provide large, clear interfaces suitable for elderly users
    2. EARLY DETECTION: Identify cognitive decline patterns before clinical symptoms
    3. CONTINUOUS MONITORING: Track daily routines, mood, and cognitive performance
    4. CAREGIVER SUPPORT: Deliver real-time alerts and trend analysis
    5. NON-INVASIVE: Require no special equipment or technical expertise
    6. CLINICAL VALIDITY: Use evidence-based cognitive assessment methods
